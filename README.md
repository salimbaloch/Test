🧠 Image Classification with Deep Learning
This repository contains an end-to-end image classification project using deep learning. The model is trained to classify images into different categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The project covers data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

🚀 Features:
Image preprocessing and augmentation

Custom CNN and/or transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

Training with validation and test sets

Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

Visualizations of training curves and predictions

📁 Dataset:
Include details about the dataset used (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset). Mention if the dataset is included, linked, or needs to be downloaded.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results:
Brief summary of model performance (e.g., accuracy, loss, etc.)
